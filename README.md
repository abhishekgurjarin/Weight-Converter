## Introduction

Hello, fellow developers! I'm thrilled to introduce my latest project: a **Weight Converter**. This project is a simple yet practical tool that helps users convert weight from pounds to kilograms. It's an excellent way to practice JavaScript, particularly in handling user inputs, calculations, and DOM manipulation. Whether you're new to JavaScript or looking for a fun, quick project, this weight converter is perfect for you.

## Project Overview

The **Weight Converter** is a web application that allows users to input a weight in pounds and get the equivalent weight in kilograms. This project showcases how to work with form inputs, perform calculations in JavaScript, and dynamically update the webpage content based on user input.

## Features

- **User Input Handling**: Accepts user input in pounds and converts it to kilograms.
- **Validation**: Displays error messages for invalid inputs (e.g., non-numeric or negative values).
- **Real-time Calculation**: Updates the conversion result immediately as the user types.
- **Responsive Design**: The layout is designed to be responsive, providing a consistent experience across devices.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Structures the weight converter interface.
- **CSS**: Styles the converter, including responsive layout and error handling.
- **JavaScript**: Manages user input validation, weight conversion, and DOM updates.

## Installation

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/abhishekgurjarin/Weight-Converter.git
    ```

2. **Open the project directory**:
    ```bash
    cd Weight-Converter
    ```

3. **Run the project**:
    - Open the `index.html` file in a web browser to use the weight converter.

## Usage

1. **Open the website** in a web browser.
2. **Enter a weight in pounds** into the input field.
3. **View the converted weight in kilograms** displayed on the page. If the input is invalid, an error message will appear.

## Conclusion

Building this Weight Converter was an enjoyable project that allowed me to explore JavaScript’s potential in handling real-time input validation and calculations. I hope this project inspires you to create similar tools that make everyday tasks easier. Feel free to explore, customize, and improve the code to suit your needs. Happy coding!
